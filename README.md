# Magic Online Replay Tool

The Magic Online Replay Tool (MORT) is a program that analyses Magic Online replays and extracts a wide range of information from them. 
Some of the interesting statistics provided by MORT are your winrate with and against certain decks, winrate on the draw/play, winrate pre-board/post-board, mulligan incidence and winrate as well as how long your games go and how likely you are to win on each turn.
